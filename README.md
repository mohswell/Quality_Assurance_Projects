### Two Quality Assurance projects: Testing a React.js City Weather App and a Vue.js Current News Articles App I developed using a public weather API and a news API.

# 1. Weather App ☀️

This project is a React.js application that fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it.

## Features ℹ️

- Display current weather information for a specified city.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on all devices.

## APIs Used 🔌

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to retrieve weather data for a given location. You can sign up and obtain your API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Setup and Usage 🛠️

### Prerequisites 📋

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation ⬇️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohswell/Quality_Assurance_Projects.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration ⚙️

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```

### Running the App 🏃‍♂️

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing 🧪

- **Unit Tests**: Implemented using Mocha.Js and Chai assertion Test Utils to ensure the correctness of components and functionalities.

```bash
npx mocha servertest.js
```

## Quality Assurance 🛡️

- **Testing**: Unit tests cover key functionalities, including weather data retrieval and display.
- **Code Linting**: ESLint is used to enforce code style and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented to gracefully handle API request failures and user input errors.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The app is tested to ensure compatibility across major browsers.
